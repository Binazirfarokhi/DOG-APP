We are going to create a form and ask user to fill the form. 
we need to have the liveserver extenstion: it allows us to start the application from the directory we are working on it
creare your boilerplate code for your html
we need some semantic tags to start: like main ->section: 
They do not have any visual outside but they have the structure for html page to start
we are going to use a mvp.css for our styleing as a framework for css

defer will first load the whole html (DOM) and then load the JS. that's why we are adding defer. if  iam going to the have an eventlistener we need to see the dom first
Add a style to your html without adding a style:
